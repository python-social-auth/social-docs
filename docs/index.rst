Welcome to Python Social Auth's documentation!
==============================================

Python Social Auth aims to be an easy-to-setup social authentication and
authorization mechanism for Python projects supporting protocols like OAuth (1
and 2), OpenID and others.

The initial codebase is derived from django-social-auth_ with the idea of
generalizing the process to suit the different frameworks around, providing
the needed tools to bring support to new frameworks.

django-social-auth_ itself was a product of modified code from
django-twitter-oauth_ and django-openid-auth_ projects.

The project is now split into smaller modules to isolate and reduce
responsibilities and improve reusability.

Code and other contributions are welcome. The code is hosted on GitHub_.
