Discourse
=========

Discourse can serve as a Single Sign On provider for Authentication.

- Deploy a Discourse application and `configure
  <https://meta.discourse.org/t/using-discourse-as-a-sso-provider/32974>` the
  application to enable Discourse as an SSO provider.

- Fill in the shared secret and url of the Discourse server in the settings::

      SOCIAL_AUTH_DISCOURSE_SECRET = "myDiscourseSecret"
      SOCIAL_AUTH_DISCOURSE_SERVER_URL = "https://my-discourse-site.com"


Using multiple Discourse instances
----------------------------------

Since Discourse is a distributed application, multiple Discourse instances can
be used as SSO providers. If this is the case, the DiscourseAuth class can be
extended and configured as follows::

      from social_core.backends.discourse import DiscourseAuth

      class DiscourseAuthFoo(DiscourseAuth):
          name = 'discourse-foo'

      class DiscourseAuthBar(DiscourseAuth):
          name = 'discourse-bar'

Fill in the settings like so::

      SOCIAL_AUTH_DISCOURSE_FOO_SECRET = "myDiscourseFooSecret"
      SOCIAL_AUTH_DISCOURSE_FOO_SERVER_URL = "https://my-discourse-foo-site.com"
      SOCIAL_AUTH_DISCOURSE_BAR_SECRET = "myDiscourseBarSecret"
      SOCIAL_AUTH_DISCOURSE_BAR_SERVER_URL = "https://my-discourse-bar-site.com"
