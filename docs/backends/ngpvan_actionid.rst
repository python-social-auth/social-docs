NGP VAN ActionID
================

`NGP VAN`_'s ActionID_ service provides an OpenID 1.1 endpoint, which provides
first name, last name, email address, and phone number.

ActionID doesn't require major settings beside being defined on
``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS``

.. code-block:: python

    SOCIAL_AUTH_AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        ...
        'social_core.backends.ngpvan.ActionIDOpenID',
        ...
    )


If you want to be able to access the "phone" attribute offered by NGP VAN
within ``extra_data`` you can add the following to your settings:

.. code-block:: python

    SOCIAL_AUTH_ACTIONID_OPENID_AX_EXTRA_DATA = [
        ('http://openid.net/schema/contact/phone/business', 'phone')
    ]


NGP VAN offers the ability to have your domain whitelisted, which will disable
the "{domain} is requesting a link to your ActionID" warning when your app
attempts to login using an ActionID account. Contact
