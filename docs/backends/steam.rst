Steam OpenID
============

Steam OpenID works quite straightforward, but to retrieve some user data (known
as ``player`` on Steam API) a Steam API Key is needed.

Configurable settings:


1. Supply a Steam API Key from `Steam Dev`_

2. Fill key in your project settings::

    SOCIAL_AUTH_STEAM_API_KEY = '...'

3. To save ``player`` data provided by Steam into ``extra_data``::

	SOCIAL_AUTH_STEAM_EXTRA_DATA = ['player']

4. Enable the backend::

    SOCIAL_AUTH_AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        ...
        'social_core.backends.steam.SteamOpenId',
        ...
    )
