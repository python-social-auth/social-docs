Readability
===========

Readability works similarly to Twitter, in that you'll need a ``Consumer Key``
and ``Consumer Secret``.  These can be obtained in the ``Connections`` section
of your ``Account`` page.

- Fill the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values in your settings::

    SOCIAL_AUTH_READABILITY_KEY = ''
    SOCIAL_AUTH_READABILITY_SECRET = ''

That's it! By default you'll get back::

    username
    first_name
    last_name

with EXTRA_DATA, you can get::

    date_joined
    kindle_email_address
    avatar_url
    email_into_address
