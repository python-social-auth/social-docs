Moves
=====

Moves_ provides an OAuth2 authentication flow. In order to enable it:

- Register an application at `Manage Your Apps`_, remember to fill the
  ``Redirect URI`` once the application was created.

- Fill **Client ID** and **Client secret** in the settings::

    SOCIAL_AUTH_MOVES_KEY = ''
    SOCIAL_AUTH_MOVES_SECRET = ''

- Define the mandatory scope for your application::

    SOCIAL_AUTH_MOVES_SCOPE = ['activity', 'location']

  The scope parameter is required by Moves_ but the backend doesn't set
  a default one to minimize the application permissions request, so it's
  mandatory for the developer to define this setting.

- Add the backend to the ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` setting::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        ...
        'social_core.backends.moves.MovesOAuth2',
        ...
    )
