Configuration
=============

All the apps share the settings names, some settings for Django framework are
special (like ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS``).

Below there's a main settings document detailing each configuration and its
purpose, plus sections detailed for each framework and their particularities.

Support for more frameworks will be added in the future, pull-requests are very
welcome.
