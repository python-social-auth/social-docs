Installation
============

python-social-auth_ is a very modular library looking to provide the
basic tools to implement social authentication / authorization in
Python projects. For that reason, the project is split in smaller
components that focus on providing a simpler functionality. Some
components are:

* social-auth-core_
  Core library that the rest depends on, this contains the basic
  functionality to establish an authentication/authorization flow with
  the different supported providers.

* social-auth-storage-sqlalchemy_, social-auth-storage-peewee_, social-auth-storage-mongoengine_
  Different storage solutions that can be reused across the supported
  frameworks or newer implementations.

* social-auth-app-django_, social-auth-app-django-mongoengine_
  Django framework integration

* social-auth-app-flask_, social-auth-app-flask-sqlalchemy_, social-auth-app-flask-mongoengine_, social-auth-app-flask-peewee_
  Flask framework integration

* social-auth-app-pyramid_
  Pyramid framework integration

* social-auth-app-cherrypy_
  Cherrypy framework integration

* social-auth-app-tornado_
  Tornado framework integration

* social-auth-app-webpy_
  Webpy framework integration


Dependencies
------------

Dependencies are properly defined in the requirements files; the
``setup.py`` script will determine the environment where it's
installed and sort between Python 2 or Python 3 packages if
needed. There are some ``extras`` defined to install the corresponding
dependencies since they are required to build extensions that, unless
used, are undesired.

* OpenIDConnect_ support requires the use of the ``openidconnect`` extra.
* SAML_ support requires the use of the ``saml`` extra.

There's also the ``all`` extra that will install all the extra options.

Several backends demand application registration on their
corresponding sites and other dependencies like SQLAlchemy_ on Flask
and Webpy.


Get a copy
----------

From PyPI_::

    $ pip install social-auth-<component>

Or, grab the relevant repository from GitHub_, then::

    $ cd social-auth-<component>
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Using the ``extras`` options
----------------------------

To enable any of the ``extras`` options to bring the dependencies for
OpenIDConnect_, or SAML_, or both::

  $ pip install "social-auth-core[openidconnect]"
  $ pip install "social-auth-core[saml]"
  $ pip install "social-auth-core[all]"
